Bugs:
Many requests aren't completing correctly. For example, see artist/search. Why is this?
-- There are many things we might not be able to handle cleanly right now with cl-web-utils.
---- Lists/arrays of arguments.
---- The idea that one of several args must be supplied.
---- POST requests involving file uploads.
-- Consequently, is cl-web-utils the best way to do this?
-- Maybe. Right now I need to know more about what's going on under those covers.
